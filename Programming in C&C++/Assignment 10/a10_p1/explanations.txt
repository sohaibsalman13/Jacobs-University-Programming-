a) If we remove the namespace std from the files we enocunter the error "string was not declared in this scope", 
   "cout was not declared in this scope", "endl was not declared in this scope". By removing the namespace std, 
   the commands assosiated with namespace std are not recognized by the program and it cannot execute the code.

   The potential solution to this would be to add "std::" before each of these undeclared variables. 
   Such as "std::cout", "std::endl" and "std::string".



b) By removing the "Critter::" from the setName method gives the error "name was not declared in this scope" 
   and by removing it from the "setHunger" method gives the error "hunger was not declared". 
   It is clear that by removing "Critter::" from a method undeclares the private variable used 
   in that method. As it is undeclared, it is not recognized and executed.

   The potential solution would be to set the undeclared variable in the public part so that it does not 
   need to be recognized with the "Critter::" prefix with a method.
